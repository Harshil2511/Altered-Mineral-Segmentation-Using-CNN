# Altered-Mineral-Segmentation-Using-CNN

Mineral segmentation in thin sections containing altered minerals is a very challenging task in computational mineralogy, and segmentation of thin section containing altered minerals is even more complex task than segmentation of those non-altered thin sections. This is because the thin sections without altered minerals like those contain sandstone or synthetic thin sections exhibit clear boundaries between minerals with no/ or shallow color changing in mineralâ€™s surface inside thin sections. Besides, thin sections created in industrial applications mostly contain altered minerals. Therefore, segmenting non-altered minerals are not a big challenge. Therefore, developing an efficient method for altered mineral segmentation in thin section provides a great help in computational mineralogy for both scientific researches and industrial applications. Majority of the minerals in thin sections, for mineralogy and petrography applications, are altered, however limited number of works addressed the segmentation of these minerals. So far, several attempts have been done for intelligent mineral segmentation and boundary detection in thin sections containing non-altered minerals proposed an algorithm for grain boundary detection in thin sections. Therefore attempt has been made to develop a project that can segment the minerals boundary producing the efficient results.
